[Gravity](https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity)
Syntax Highlighting for vim.

Since gravity has quite a similar structure to swift, this has been modified
from
[keith/swift.vim](https://github.com/keith/swift.vim), and will be updated from
now on to work better with gravity.

This syntax highlight supports the file extensions `.gravity` and `.gr`

## Installation

Use your favourite vim plugin manager. If you do not have one, check out
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Otherwise, just copy the folders to your .vim directory.
